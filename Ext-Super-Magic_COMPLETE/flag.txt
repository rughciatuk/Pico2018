First we need to edit the hex of the file because
`file` return data. Looking on google ext (because
of the name of the problem) gets that at offset 0x438
there need to be 53ef, so edit that with `ghex`.
After that we can open the filesystem in `testdisk`
and copy the file "flag.jpg" to local directory.
The flag is part of the image.
